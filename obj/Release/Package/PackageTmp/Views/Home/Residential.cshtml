        <h4>Residential Carpet Cleaning</h4>
        <p>Carpet is an expensive investment that adds so much to the beauty and comfort of our homes.  
        But like anything that we value, it needs to be maintained.  Valley Carpet Cleaning has the equipment and trained personnel to properly care for this. 
        How often should carpeting  be cleaned?</p>
        <p>It is recommended that carpeting be cleaned on a 12-18 month rotation.  Of course, there are many factors that effect that estimate.  
        As parents know, children and pets can do much to speed up the need for thorough carpet cleaning.  Other factors that affect cleaning frequency 
        are the type of carpeting, location in the home, frequency of vacuuming and the list goes on and on. </p>
        <p>The real key is to find what works for circumstances.  Sadly, many wait until the carpets look very dirty and soiled. 
        While we are happy to clean them for you (and the effect will be dramatic) this is not beneficial for them or you. 
        Dirt and other solid matter deep in the carpet act like small grinders as they break down the fibers. 
        This, among other things, enhances the appearances of "traffic patterns" that cannot be cleaned away. 
        Something else to remember is that carpet acts like a large filter in your home. It traps dust, pollens and other items that can be "kicked up" 
        into the air as children and animals play, or as people walk through.  A proper cleaning can remove these allergens and foreign matter from your carpet.</p>

        <h4>Why use Valley Carpet Cleaning?</h4>
        <p>In an effort to save money, some will attempt to clean their rugs themselves.  While we applaud the effort of the "do-it-yourselfer", 
        the results are not nearly as effective as a certified carpet cleaning technician with the right equipment.  
        Rental machines are ineffective in deep cleaning your carpets. They tend to clean only the surface while over-wetting the carpet and forcing 
        dirt further down into it.  This is not a good solution for the your health or the longevity of your carpet.</p>
        <p>Valley Carpet Cleaning uses powerful "truck-mounted" carpet cleaning equipment.  This equipment produces tremendous heat, 
        pressure and vacuum suction that allows for deep cleaning with quick dry times. But the effectiveness of a tool is reduced if not 
        in the hands of a competent person.  A Valley Carpet Cleaning technician is trained and certified by the IICRC organization.  
        We understand the science behind cleaning.  Thus, we are able to use the most effective solutions and methods to care for your carpet.</p>
